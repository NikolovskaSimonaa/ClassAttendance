# Class Attendance

## Architecture used for building this application:

1. XML
2. Java
3. SQLite

## Application guide:

* Users are separated in two roles: professor and student. The professor role can create subjects and classes for that subjects. Students can enroll to the subjects and have an overview to the classes of the enrolled subjects.

* In the duration time of the class, the enrolled students can confirm their attendance and professors have real time attendance check for each class. When the class ends, the students can no longer confirm attendance to that class. Students that have confirmed their attendance receive a survey form, where they anonymously give a review to the class. The list with the reviews from the survey can only be seen by the professor.
